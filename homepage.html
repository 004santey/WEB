        <h2> Message From Our Principal</h2>
        <p>It is both my pleasure and privilege to welcome you to GANGA, a school with a new vision. 
            We have successfully completed the sixth year, the most challenging years after the inception, 
            with the kind support of our valued parents, guardians and well wishers. We would like to extend 
            our sincere gratitude to all who put their trust upon us. We are driven to provide all the children
             at GANGA the best possible educational experience. Life at GANGA is not just about academic brilliance.
              Our students come to us from different socio- political, economical, cultural background, but they 
              share common bonds: they value learnng ,respect each other and appreciate the skills and expertise of 
              their teachers and friends. We believe that students are individuals with rights and responsibilities
               therefore; we assist students to progressively accept more responsibility for self-discipline, to 
               develop self respect, to contribute to the community, to develop a love of learning, and to strive for 
               excellence.We are a comprehensive, co-educational school, offering an environment that reflects our 
               society and better prepares students for their future lives as an honest democratic citizen of 
              Nepal who can lead the nation tomorrow. </p>
